I dreamed I was missing, u r so scared
But none would listen, 'cause none else cared
After my dreaming, I woke up with this fear
What I'm leaving when I've done here?

So if u ask me, I want u to know
When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your mind leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest, don't be afraid
I've taken my beating, I've shared what I made
I'm strong on the surface, not all the way through
I've never been perfect, but neither have you

So if you ask me, I want u to know
When my time comes, forget the wrong that i've done
Help me leave behind some reasons to be missed
Don't resent me when u're feeling empty
Keep me in your mind, leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest.

Forgetting all the hurt inside you've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else can come and save me from myself
I can't be who u r

When my time comes, forget the wrong that I've done
