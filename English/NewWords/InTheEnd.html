<h1 class="title">it starts with one thing</h1>


<p>
it starts with one thing
</p>
<p>
i don't why
</p>
<p>
it doesn't even matter how hard u try
</p>
<p>
keep that in mind that i designed this rhyme to explain in due time
</p>
<p>
all i know
</p>
<p>
time is a valuable thing
</p>
<p>
watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
</p>
<p>
watch it count down to the end of the day
</p>
<p>
the clock ticks life away
</p>
<p>
it's so unreal
</p>
<p>
didn't look out below
</p>
<p>
watch the time go right out the window
</p>
<p>
try to hold on but didn't even know
</p>
<p>
wasted it all to watch u go
</p>
<p>
i kept everything inside and
</p>
<p>
even though i tried it all fell apart
</p>
<p>
what it meant to me will
</p>
<p>
eventually be a memory of a time when
</p>
<p>
i tried so hard
</p>
<p>
and got so far
</p>
<p>
but in the end
</p>
<p>
it doesn't matter
</p>
<p>
i hard to fall
</p>
<p>
to lost it all
</p>
<p>
but in the end
</p>
<p>
it doesn't even matter
</p>


<p>
one thing
</p>
<p>
i don't why
</p>
<p>
it doesn't even matter how hard u try
</p>
<p>
keep that in mind that i designed this rhyme to remind myself how
</p>
<p>
i tried so hard in spite of the way u were mocking me
</p>
<p>
acting like i was part of your property
</p>
<p>
remembering all the times u fought with me
</p>
<p>
i'm surprised it got so far
</p>
<p>
things aren't the way they were before
</p>
<p>
you wouldn't even recognize me anymore
</p>
<p>
not that u knew me back then
</p>
<p>
but it all comes back to me in the end
</p>


<p>
u kept everything inside
</p>
<p>

to lost it all
</p>
<p>
but in the end
</p>
<p>
it doesn't even matter
</p>
<p>
i've put my trust in u
</p>
<p>
pushed as far as i can go
</p>
<p>
for all this
</p>
<p>
there's only one thing u should know
</p>
<p>
i put my trust in u
