it starts with one thing
i don't why
it doesn't even matter how hard u try
keep that in mind that i designed this rhyme to explain in due time
all i know
time is a valuable thing
watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
watch it count down to the end of the day
the clock ticks life away
it's so unreal
didn't look out below
watch the time go right out the window
try to hold on but didn't even know
wasted it all to watch u go
i kept everything inside and
even though i tried it all fell apart
what it meant to me will
eventually be a memory of a time when
i tried so hard
and got so far
but in the end
it doesn't matter
i hard to fall
to lost it all
but in the end
it doesn't even matter

one thing
i don't why
it doesn't even matter how hard u try
keep that in mind that i designed this rhyme to remind myself how
i tried so hard in spite of the way u were mocking me
acting like i was part of your property
remembering all the times u fought with me
i'm surprised it got so far
things aren't the way they were before
you wouldn't even recognize me anymore
not that u knew me back then
but it all comes back to me in the end

u kept everything inside
and even though i tried
it all fell apart

what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when i
try so hard
and so far
but in the end
it doesn't matter
i had to fall
to lost it all
but in the end
it doesn't even matter
i've put my trust in u
pushed as far as i can go
for all this
there's only one thing u should know
i put my trust in u
pushed as far as i can go
for all this
there's only one thing u should know
i tried so hard
and got so far
but in the end
it doesn't even matter
i had to fell
to lose it all
but in the end
it doesn't even matter
